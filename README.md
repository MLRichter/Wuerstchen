# W端rstchen
 
## What is this?
W端rstchen is a new framework for training text-conditional models by moving the computationally expensive text-conditional stage into a highly compressed latent space. Common approaches make use of a single stage compression, while W端rstchen introduces another Stage that introduces even more compression. In total we have Stage A & B that are responsible for compressing images and Stage C that learns the text-conditional part in the low dimensional latent space. With that W端rstchen achieves a 42x compression factor, while still reconstructing images faithfully. This enables training of Stage C to be fast and computationally cheap. We refer to [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07292) for details.
